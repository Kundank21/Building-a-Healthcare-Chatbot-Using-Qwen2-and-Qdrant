The chatbot enhances hospital management by providing real-time updates on facility resources. It can inform staff about the availability of rooms, schedules for operating theaters, and any urgent operational needs, ensuring smooth and optimized hospital operations. This capability helps administrators allocate resources effectively, reducing wait times for patients and improving overall hospital efficiency.
